## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability. It will be immediately closed and you will not be credited, nor will you be notified when the vulnerability is fixed.
2. Send an email to [maxime.le-besnerais@epitech.eu](mailto:maxime.le-besnerais@epitech.eu) with the details of the vulnerability.
3. Wait for acknowledgment from the project maintainers.
4. Once the issue is confirmed, I will work on resolving it and notify you of our progress.

## Responsible Disclosure

I believe in responsible disclosure, and I kindly ask that you:

- Allow me a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before making any public disclosure.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability, but only perform actions that are necessary to identify and demonstrate the vulnerability's impact.
- Keep in mind that this project only interact with your local git repository, so the impact of a vulnerability is limited to your local machine.
- This project is not a security-critical project, so I will not be able to offer a monetary reward for the disclosure. However, I will credit you in the release notes for your responsible disclosure.

I commit to addressing reported security vulnerabilities promptly and keeping you informed of my progress throughout the process.


## Maintainer Response

I will try to acknowledge your email within 7 days, and will do my best to keep you informed of my progress.

Please note that I am maintaining this project on my free time, so thank you for your patience in advance.
